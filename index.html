<p>My portfolio will show the history and the complexites of my code throught the year. I have done four big projects. The first projhect was making an art of nay choice I chose to do block stacked on top of each other with stars on the top. The second project was a Robot project that UI decided to make the robot go back and fourth forever. The third projerct was a discord bot where If people typed a certain word the discord bot would reposnd with a few lines of funnny resposnes. The last and hardest project that I did was flashcards where it took you thorugh a common knowledge test where you would answer a few questions and at the end it would tell you your score in percenteges. </p>
