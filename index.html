<p>My portfolio demonstrates the evolution and increasing complexity of my coding skills throughout the year through four major projects.
  Project 1: Digital Art Creation
  For my first project, I created a digital art piece featuring geometric blocks stacked vertically with decorative stars positioned at the top. This project introduced me to basic programming concepts and visual design.
  Project 2: Autonomous Robot
  My second project involved programming a robot with continuous movement patterns. I designed the robot to move back and forth in a perpetual loop, which helped me understand automation and basic robotics programming.
  Project 3: Discord Bot
  The third project was an interactive Discord bot that responded to specific user inputs. When users typed certain trigger words, the bot would reply with a selection of humorous responses, teaching me about API integration and user interaction design.
  Project 4: Interactive Flashcard Quiz
  My most challenging project was a comprehensive flashcard application that administered a general knowledge quiz. The program guided users through multiple-choice questions and calculated their final score as a percentage, demonstrating my growth in data handling, user interface design, and mathematical calculations.
  Each project built upon the previous one, showing my progression from basic visual programming to complex interactive applications. </p>
