    <p>should_i_respond() acts as a filter - it checks incoming messages for specific trigger words like "hello bot", "flip", "joke", "weather", or certain names. If it finds any of these keywords, it returns True to signal the bot should respond.
      respond() is where the bot generates its actual replies. It looks at what the user said and responds accordingly - telling jokes if they ask for one, flipping a virtual coin, sharing random facts, giving weather updates, or providing character-specific responses for certain names like "henry" or "gordon".
      The bot has personality quirks built in, like sharing Gordon Ramsay insults, making jokes about a user named Henry getting killed by a Minecraft pillager, and scrambling text when asked. It also includes some standalone game functions for Twister and Rock Paper Scissors, though the Rock Paper Scissors game would run separately from the chat bot.
      Essentially, users type messages, the bot scans for keywords, and then responds with pre-programmed funny or helpful replies based on what it detected. </p>

    <h2>File I/O is a little weird for the python-in-a-website library 
      I'm using.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Add your actual flashcards project code into the "flashcards"
      subdirectory within this repository. (You can copy each file over, or
      you can use <code>git subtree add -P <prefix> <repo> <rev></code>)</li>
      <li>If you need any data files to exist <b>before</b> you run your 
      python code, add the paths to those files into the "py-config" tag 
      within the "head" tag of this html file. The key is the actual
      location within this projct and the vlue is the way your python
      code will ask for the file.</li>
      <li>The way I've written this, your code won't have any memory actually 
      saved. Once the user refreshes the page, all the files get overwritten
      to their original state.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>your code will run here:</p>
